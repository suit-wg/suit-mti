1.  Introduction

   This document specifies algorithm profiles for SUIT manifest parsers
   and authors to ensure better interoperability.  These profiles apply
   specifically to a constrained node software update use case.
   Mandatory algorithms may change over time due to an evolving threat
   landscape.  Algorithms are grouped into algorithm profiles to account
   for this.  Profiles may be deprecated over time.  SUIT will define
   five choices of Mandatory To Implement (MTI) profile specifically for
   constrained node software update.  These profiles are:

   *  One Symmetric MTI profile

Internet-Draft             MTI SUIT Algorithms                March 2025


   *  Two "Current" Constrained Asymmetric MTI profiles

   *  Two "Current" AEAD Asymmetric MTI profiles

   *  One "Future" Constrained Asymmetric MTI profile

   At least one MTI algorithm in each category MUST be FIPS qualified.

   Because SUIT presents an asymmetric communication profile, where
   manifest authors have unlimited resources and manifest recipients
   have constrained resources, the requirements for Recipients and
   Authors are different.

   Recipients MAY choose which MTI profile they wish to implement.  It
   is RECOMMENDED that they implement the "Future" Asymmetric MTI
   profile.  Recipients MAY implement any number of other profiles.
   Recipients MAY choose not to implement an encryption algorithm if
   encrypted payloads will never be used.

   Authors MUST implement all MTI profiles.  Authors MAY implement any
   number of other profiles.

   Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD) is preferred
   over un-authenticated encryption.  Where possible an AEAD profile
   SHOULD be selected.  Certain constrained IoT applications require on-
   the-fly decryption, which necessitates a non-AEAD encryption
   algorithm.  If the application is not a constrained device, the two
   AEAD profiles are RECOMMENDED.

   Other use-cases of the SUIT Manifest ([I-D.ietf-suit-manifest]) MAY
   define their own MTI algorithms.

2.  Algorithms

   The algorithms that form a part of the profiles defined in this
   document are grouped into:

   *  Digest Algorithms

   *  Authentication Algorithms

   *  Key Exchange Algorithms (OPTIONAL)

   *  Encryption Algorithms (OPTIONAL)

                                  Table 6

   This draft does not specify a particular set of HSS-LMS parameters.
   Deep trees are RECOMMENDED due to key lifetimes in IoT devices.

4.  Reporting Profiles

   When using Manifest Recipients Response communication, particularly
   data structures that are designed for reporting of update
   capabilities, status, progress, or success, the same profile as the
   is used on the SUIT manifest SHOULD be used.  There are cases where
   this is not possible, such as suit-sha256-hsslms-a256kw-a256ctr.  In
   this case, the closest equivalent profile SHOULD be used, for example
   suit-sha256-es256-ecdh-a128ctr.

5.  Security Considerations

   For the avoidance of doubt, there are scenarios where payload or
   manifest encryption are not required.  In these scenarios, the
   encryption element of the selected profile is simply not used.

   AES-CTR mode is specified, see [RFC9459].  All of the AES-CTR
   security considerations in [RFC9459] apply.  A non-AEAD encryption
   mode is specified in this draft due to the following mitigating
   circumstances:

   *  On-the-fly decryption (without the whole payload) must be
      supported.  Therefore, there is no difference between AEAD and
      plaintext hash verification.

   *  Out-of-order decryption must be supported.  Therefore, we must use
      a stream cipher that supports random access.

Internet-Draft             MTI SUIT Algorithms                March 2025


   *  Chosen plaintext attacks are extremely difficult to achieve, since
      the payloads are typically constructed in a relatively secure
      environment--the developer's computer or build infrastructure--and
      should be signed in an air-gapped or similarly protected
      environment.  In short, the plaintext is authenticated prior to
      encryption.

   *  Content Encryption Keys must be used to encrypt only once.  See
      [I-D.ietf-suit-firmware-encryption].

   As a result of these mitigating circumstances, AES-CTR is an
   acceptable cipher for typical software/firmware delivery scenarios.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a page for COSE Algorithm Profiles within
   the category for Software Update for the Internet of Things (SUIT)

   IANA is also requested to create a registry for COSE Alforithm
   Profiles within this page.  The initial content of the registry is:

Appendix A.  A.  Full CDDL

   The following CDDL creates a subset of COSE for use with SUIT.  Both
   tagged and untagged messages are defined.  SUIT only uses tagged COSE
   messages, but untagged messages are also defined for use in protocols
   that share a ciphersuite with SUIT.

   To be valid, the following CDDL MUST have the COSE CDDL appended to
   it.  The COSE CDDL can be obtained by following the directions in
   [RFC9052], Section 1.4.
